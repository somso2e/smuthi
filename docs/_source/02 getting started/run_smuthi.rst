Running a simulation
======================

Create a simulation script
--------------------------

To start a Smuthi simulation, you need to write a simulation script and save it with the file ending `.py`, for example `my_simulation.py`.

In the :doc:`examples <../04 examples/examples>` section you can find a number of example 
scripts that illustrate the use of Smuthi. Edit and run these scripts to get a 
quick start.

The :ref:`guidelinesAnchor` provide the necessary understanding how a simulation script is built.

For furhter details, the :doc:`API section <../05 api/smuthi_api>` contains a description
of all of Smuthi's modules, classes and functions.

Running the simulation script
-----------------------------

To execute the simulation, run the script by 

Ubuntu::

  python3 my_simulation.py
	
Windows::

  python my_simulation.py
